Today's post is an easy one because I didn't *do* anything cool with my homelab today, strictly speaking. Today was just a research day. Googling new technologies, pricing out new hardware on ebay, and just kinda spending time thinking about the future of what my homelab would look like.
I'm not out of homelab tasks to do by any means, just today I needed to take a step back and evaluate so that my future efforts are more focused.

Topics researched included:
- Adding a second CPU to my R530
- More RAM for said R530 as well
- Compatible CPUs with my HP Proliant M110 Gen 9
- Task planning and project management software
- New web development technologies (thanks Stack Overflow Dev Survey)
- CI/CD (likely going to be a big focus of this 100 days of homelab)
